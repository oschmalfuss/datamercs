## Introduction
This is a short introduction - and personel reminder - on how to use the `test` command.  
The Google "[Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)" prefers double `[[ … ]]` over the older (but POSIX portable) single `[ … ]` or literal `test` and I won't question this. ^[ `[[ … ]]` reduces errors as no pathname expansion or word splitting takes place between `[[` and `]]`. In addition, `[[ … ]]` allows for regular expression matching, while `[ … ]` does not. ]  
  
The `test` command returns 0 (True) or 1 (False), which we can use conditionally in *if-loops* or using the *&&* and *||* operators, and one could also simply examine the return value by displaying `$?` e.g.

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
$ [[ "foo" != "bar" ]]; echo $?
0

$ [[ "foo" == "bar" ]]; echo $?
1

$ [[ "foo" == "foo" ]]; echo $?
0

$ [[ "foo" != "foo" ]]; echo $?
1

$ [[ 5 > 2 ]]; echo $?
0

```

There are tons of applications, but we will mostly use it to `grep` for certain outputs or check `variables` or for the existence of files.  
Consult `help test` for further details.  

## Using 'test' in loops / conditional statements

### if-else

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}

var=baz # this is out test input, i.e. [[ "foo" == $var ]] will return "False" (i.e. "1"): [[ "foo" == $var ]]; echo $? vs. [[ "baz" == $var ]]; echo $?

if [[ "foo" == $var ]]; then
  echo "VAR equals foo"
elif [[ "bar" == $var ]]; then
  echo "VAR equals bar"
else
  echo "we got it all wrong and VAR equals something else"
fi

```

The use of `echo` here is just a substitute for any command that might be used here.

### && and || operators

There is a more cunning, and cryptic, way of writing if-statements using the **&&** and **||** operators.  
**&&** and **||** are actually *LOGICAL* operators, i.e.

>  && = AND  
>  || = OR

the general logic for scripting or chaining commands would be

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
"FOO ; BAR"      # Run FOO and then BAR, regardless of success of FOO
"FOO && BAR"     # Run BAR if FOO succeeded, i.e. returns "True"
"FOO || BAR"     # Run BAR if FOO failed, i.e. returns "False"
"FOO &"          # Run FOO in the background.
"FOO | BAR"      # pipe the output of FOO into BAR for further processing
```

to substitute an if-else-loop use as follows

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
# the nifty way
[[ "foo" != "bar" ]] && echo "true, foo != bar" || echo "if false, obviously VAR must have been foo then as well"

# which is the same as
if [[ "foo" != "bar" ]]; then
  echo "true, foo != bar"
else
  echo "if false, obviously VAR must have been foo then as well"
fi

```

these operators can also be used to chain multiple tests/ conditions together into one `test` e.g.

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
$ var=baz
# OR; is one or the other "True"
$ [[ "foo" == $var || "baz" == $var ]] && echo "true" || echo "false"
true
# AND; both must be "True"
$ [[ "foo" == $var && "baz" == $var ]] && echo "true" || echo "false"
false
```


## Using 'test' for checking files - test existence
For example, when I'm downloading, extracting and forwarding files based on a list of ISBNs and do not know whether I'll find a package for each of the given ISBNs, then I need to know the failed ISBN, so that I do not include it within my extra metadata file, in which I only want to provide data for succeeded ISBNs.

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
ISBNLIST=ISBNs4NYU.txt
BASEDIR=$(pwd)
WORKDIR=$BASEDIR/ProQuest_Deposit_$(date +%F); mkdir $WORKDIR; cp $ISBNLIST $WORKDIR; cd $WORKDIR

# Download WebPDFs directly out of the PDW
for ISBN in $(cat $ISBNLIST); do
  echo $ISBN
  # getting "documentId"
  DOCUMENTID=$(curl -s --proxy "http://proxy-URL:1337" https://product-data-warehouse-URL/publication/$ISBN | grep '"id"' | head -n1 | grep -oP '(?<="id" : ").+?(?=")')
  # downloading ZIP
  curl -s --proxy "http://proxy-URL:1337" https://product-data-warehouse-URL/document/$DOCUMENTID/zip -o $ISBN.zip
  # unzip WebPDF only
  unzip -q -j $ISBN.zip *$DOCUMENTID.pdf
  # rename to ISBN.pdf
  mv $DOCUMENTID.pdf $ISBN.pdf
  # if WebPDF exists, then upload to target FTP
  if [[ -f $ISBN.pdf ]]; then
    curl -T $ISBN.pdf -u UN:PW ftp://ftp.data-recipient.com/upload/
    echo "$ISBN" >> isbn_list_4_onix.txt
    else echo "$ISBN" >> WebPDF_missing.txt
  fi
  # clean-up
  rm $ISBN.zip $ISBN.pdf
done

cd $BASEDIR

```

I usually only need `-f`, but again check `help test` for other options like

> File operators:  
> -d FILE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True if file is a directory.  
> -e FILE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True if file exists [regardless of type, e.g. file, directory, device etc.].  
> -f FILE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True if file exists and is a regular file [and not a directory or device etc.].  

This check could also be negated, so that the outcome is "True" when the file does NOT exist:

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
if [[ ! -f $ISBN.pdf ]]; then
    echo "$ISBN.pdf does not exist."
fi
```

## Using 'test' for checking variables
For example, prompt user to specify a file, like an ISBN list, when there was no command line argument (i.e. `$1`) given in the first place:

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
# check for input variable, if empty prompt for file in current directory, else move on with the given input variable
if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
  echo; echo "Please select ISBN list: (choose number)"; echo
  select L in *; do test -n "$L" && break; echo ">>> Invalid Selection"; done
else
  L=$1
fi
```

> String operators:  
> -z STRING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True if string is empty.  
> -n STRING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True if string is NOT empty.  

```{bash eval=F, echo=T}
# nifty alternative
[[ -z "$var" ]] && echo "true, VAR is empty" || echo "false, VAR is Not empty"
```
