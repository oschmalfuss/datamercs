  Not many people realize that on bash you do not necessarily need a full blown text editor like vim, emacs or nano, or need to remember the heredoc logic to write text on the command line:
  All you need is some "cat magic"
  Here is how!

## // cat: concatenate and WRITE files

Not many people realize that on `bash` you do not necessarily need a full blown text editor like vim, emacs or nano, or need to remember the heredoc logic to write multi-line text on the command line, but that for most cases good ol' [cat](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cat-invocation.html) is all you needed.  
  
All you need to do is `cat` into a(n empty) file and close with **CTRL+d**  
  
One can add some extra text with **>>** again 

```

$ cat > text.txt
The Lord of the Rings
is one of those things
if you like it you do

# CTRL+d to finish

# let's add some more text to the same file
$ cat >> text.txt
if you don't then you boo

# CTRL+d to finish

# result:
$ cat text.txt
The Lord of the Rings
is one of those things
if you like it you do
if you don't then you boo


# same in heredoc logic
cat << EOF > text.txt
The Lord of the Rings
is one of those things
if you like it you do
if you don't then you boo
EOF

```
